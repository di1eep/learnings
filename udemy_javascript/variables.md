# Naming Conventions in Programming

## Variable Naming Conventions

### Camel Case
- **Format:** `firstName`
- **Usage:** Commonly used for assigning variables.

### Snake Case
- **Format:** `first_name`
- **Usage:** Sometimes used for assigning variables, especially in certain programming languages like Python.

### Kebab Case
- **Format:** `first-name`
- **Usage:** Rarely used in programming due to hyphens being interpreted as minus signs.

### Pascal Case
- **Format:** `FirstName`
- **Usage:** Commonly used for assigning functions and classes.

## Legal and Illegal Naming Conventions

### Illegal Naming Conventions
- Cannot use any special symbols (`&, *, ^, %, ...`).
- Cannot use reserved keywords (e.g., `function`, `new`).

### Legal Naming Conventions
- Can use only `_` and `$`.
- Reserved keywords can be used as part of names but cannot be the entire name (e.g., `name`, `my_function`).

By following these conventions, your code will be more readable and maintainable.
